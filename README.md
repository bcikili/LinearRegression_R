# LinearRegression_R

It is a well known phenomena that most of us shrink throughout the day each day. The effects of gravity cause that our height measured at the end of the day is less than our height measured at the beginning of the day. Fortunately, at night, our bodies stretch out again, so that from one morning to the next, each of us has returned to the morning height from the day before.
In the 'heights' dataset, there are AM and PM height measurements (in mm) for students from a boarding school in India.

Using this dataset, we test linear regression assumptions, correct the violations.
